# NASA SpaceApps Challenge 2023

Over the weekend, the 42 Málaga Fundación Telefónica campus hosted the NASA Space Apps Challenge hackathon 2023, bringing together more than 70 participants organized into 11 teams at the Málaga headquarters. 
After two days of work and the final presentation of projects before a jury of five experts in various fields of knowledge, FireWatcher, the team they were part of consisting of 6 students from 42 Málaga, were chosen as the winners of the hackathon.
Now, they are set to compete on the international stage against winners from other participating cities across the globe. From this competition, six winners will be selected, earning the opportunity to travel to the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, USA, to showcase their ideas to NASA experts from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

FireWatcher is an application that allows authorities detect fires and alert the population that can be affected. In this project, the processing through neural networks of all the data collected since the moment an event is triggered, is essential. The final objective is to prevent and act as quickly as possible in the event of wildfires.
